# Errata for *Pro C# 9 with .NET 5*

On **page 105** [code error]:
 
The first line if ExecutePatternMatchingSwitch:
2.5 should read 2.5m   —  This is required for consistency with the coding error.

The actual coding error is in case “3”.  Where 2.5 should read 2.5m.

Without the m (indicating decimal) the default statements are executed rather than the case 3 Statements Which is the intentIon.
